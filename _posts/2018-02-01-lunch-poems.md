> There was a young researcher called Titipat<br/>
> he was trying to code in dot mat<br/>
> The code didn't work<br/>
> and he went berserk<br/>
> so people called him Matlab expat<br/>


> There was a belief of Roozbeh(s)<br/>
> That all went according to rule Bayes<br/>
> At the casino, he lost money and didn't find it that funny<br/>
> Intuitions work better<br/>
> Heuristic to the letter<br/>
> Now never with stats he now plays<br/>
