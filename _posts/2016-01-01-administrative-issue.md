Konrad is clueless about administrative things. Mengwei Liu (`mliu@ric.org`) is Konrad's point person for all administrative things. For anything that she can not solve herself she can arrange that the right person in charge will handle it. For NU related things she may ask you to directly talk to Matthew Irwin (`m-irwin@northwestern.edu`). Also, keep in mind that Konrad is most definitely clueless about things.
