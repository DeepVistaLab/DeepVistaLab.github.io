title: I want a 1 million channel amplifier
categories: discussion

No seriously, why can we not have a 1M channel amplifier? I am just following up a discussion I had with @stochastician. Any input that people could give to help understand this would be awesome. And obviously my interests are related to the ongoing quest to [record all neurons from a mouse brain](http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5709).

### State of the art in Neurophysiology

Intan (and many others) produce amplifiers that take neurophysiological signals and amplify/ digitize them. Here is an example. an intan amplifier They have a couple dozen channels.

### State of the art in Imaging

An imaging chip pretty much takes 10 million weak inputs and amplifies each of them while reading it out in a massively multiplexed format so that we get high precision readings from each of the channels. Some such chips even do supercool spike coding (Tobi Delbruck).

### Why the difference

Why can we not have digitizing amplifiers that have millions of channels? What if it would be worth a million dollars? There must be a fundamental reason why this isnt possible. Is there an issue with noise? How much more noise would such a high density amplifier have? Or is there an impedance issue? How? Somehow I do not understand that difference. Please email/facebook/tweet if you can help me understand.
