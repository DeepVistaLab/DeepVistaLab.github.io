##### Hololens

Mixed reality (MR) has promise for learning, design, and entertainment, and for use during everyday life. However, in such cases there may be an interaction; will a mixed reality object make us fall or otherwise perturb us? To address this kind of question we recruited subjects, instructed them to stand quietly, and measured how much events presented in mixed reality (Microsoft HoloLens) affected their stance. We analyzed the effects of solid object and text, in both a static and a dynamic setting.
